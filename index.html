        <h2>Scenario 1</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Check to make sure that the correct things are imported into excel and in the correct order after changes are made to the grid
            </li>
            <li>
                Make sure the changes persist. For example when you go to a new page of entries, would your changes revert to the way they are or stay the same
            </li>
            <li>
                Another thing that I would look for is to make sure moving items around on the screen with this drag and drop functionality doesn’t affect the overall layout of the webpage.
            </li>
            <li>
                Test the actual movement of the items in the grid. Does the drag and drop functionality work properly.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        <h2>Scenario 2</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Check to make sure that this field is populated when you look at a member.
            </li>
            <li>
                Since it is a relationship, I don’t think the entry of numbers should be allowed, so I would check to see if I was allowed to enter number in the emergency contact relationship box.
            </li>
            <li>
                Another good thing to test would be to make sure that it saves, edits and deletes properly.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        <h2>Scenario 3</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                First I would check to make sure the changes actually worked. I would import an excel file without any birthday and month and see what happens 
            </li>
            <li>
                I would test with different formats for the birthday and year. For example (April 1st, 1995 | Apr 1 1995 |  04/01/1995 | etc)           
            </li>
            <li>
                I would also check to be sure that these changes didn’t affect the other fields in the file. Such as Name, email, etc.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
